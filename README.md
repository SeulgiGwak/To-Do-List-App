<h1>To-Do List App</h1>

<h2> 📖 Overview </h2>
<p>This is a simple To-Do List web application where users can add, delete, and manage tasks. It's designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and built with core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app is ideal for practicing front-end development and offers essential features for task management.</p>


<h2> 🚀 Features </h2>
<p>* Add New Tasks: Users can enter and add new tasks to the list.

* Delete Tasks: Tasks can be deleted once completed or if they are no longer needed.

* Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can visually mark tasks as completed (e.g., with a checkmark or crossed-out text).

* Simple UI: The interface is clean and simple, focused on usability and ease of interaction.

* Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, meaning it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>


<h2> 💻 Technologies Used </h2>
<p>* HTML: For the structure and layout of the app.

* CSS: For styling and responsiveness.

* JavaScript: To provide interactivity (adding, deleting, and completing tasks).</p>


<h2>📥 Installation </h2>
<p>To get started with this project on your local machine:

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>

Open the index.html file in any browser to launch the app.

No installation of additional tools or frameworks is needed.

<h2> 📱 Usage </h2>
<p>* Add Tasks: Type a task in the input field and click the Add Task button to add it to your list.

* Mark Tasks as Complete: Check a task (or strike it through) to mark it as completed.

* Delete Tasks: Click the Delete button next to any task you want to remove from the list.</p>



<h2> 🔧 How It Works </h2>
<p>* Add Tasks: The input box allows you to type in tasks. When you press the Add Task button, a new task is added to the list.

* Complete Tasks: Once a task is completed, it can be marked (visually) as completed. This may involve adding a "checked" effect or strikethrough on the task text.

* Delete Tasks: If a task is no longer needed, you can click the Delete button next to it to remove it from the list.</p>



<h2> 🌱 Future Improvements </h2>
<p>* Add the ability to edit tasks after they’ve been created.

* Implement localStorage to save tasks even when the page is refreshed.

* Allow users to filter tasks (e.g., show only completed tasks or active tasks).

* Add drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks. </p>



<h2> 🛠️ Roadmap </h2>
 <p> * Task Completion: Implement features to mark tasks as "done" with a checkbox or strikethrough.

* Error Handling: Ensure that if the input field is empty, the user is alerted and no task is added.

* Styling Enhancements: Improve the overall design, including color schemes, fonts, and animations. </p>
