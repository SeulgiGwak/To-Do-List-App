    <h1>To-Do List App</h1>

    <h2>📖 Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This is a simple To-Do List web application where users can add, delete, and manage tasks. It's designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and built with core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app is ideal for practicing front-end development and offers essential features for task management.
    </p>

    <h2>🚀 Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Add New Tasks</strong>: Users can enter and add new tasks to the list.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete Tasks</strong>: Tasks can be deleted once completed or if they are no longer needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Mark Tasks as Completed</strong>: Users can visually mark tasks as completed (e.g., with a checkmark or crossed-out text).</li>
        <li><strong>Simple UI</strong>: The interface is clean and simple, focused on usability and ease of interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: The app is fully responsive, meaning it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💻 Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML</strong>: For the structure and layout of the app.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS</strong>: For styling and responsiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: To provide interactivity (adding, deleting, and completing tasks).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📥 Installation</h2>
    <p>To get started with this project on your local machine:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone this repository to your local machine:
            <pre><code>git clone &lt;repository-url&gt;</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Open the <code>index.html</code> file in any browser to launch the app.</li>
        <li>No installation of additional tools or frameworks is needed. Simply open the project folder and double-click the <code>index.html</code> file.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>📱 Usage</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Add Tasks</strong>: Type a task in the input field and click the <strong>Add Task</strong> button to add it to your list.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Mark Tasks as Complete</strong>: Check a task (or strike it through) to mark it as completed.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Delete Tasks</strong>: Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button next to any task you want to remove from the list.</p>

    <h2>🔧 How It Works</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Add Tasks</strong>: The input box allows you to type in tasks. When you press the <strong>Add Task</strong> button, a new task is added to the list.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Complete Tasks</strong>: Once a task is completed, it can be marked (visually) as completed. This may involve adding a "checked" effect or strikethrough on the task text.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Delete Tasks</strong>: If a task is no longer needed, you can click the <strong>Delete</strong> button next to it to remove it from the list.</p>

    <h2>🌱 Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the ability to <strong>edit tasks</strong> after they’ve been created.</li>
        <li>Implement <strong>localStorage</strong> to save tasks even when the page is refreshed.</li>
        <li>Allow users to <strong>filter tasks</strong> (e.g., show only completed tasks or active tasks).</li>
        <li>Add <strong>drag-and-drop</strong> functionality to reorder tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🛠️ Roadmap</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Task Completion</strong>: Implement features to mark tasks as "done" with a checkbox or strikethrough.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Ensure that if the input field is empty, the user is alerted and no task is added.</li>
        <li><strong>Styling Enhancements</strong>: Improve the overall design, including color schemes, fonts, and animations.</li>
    </ul>
