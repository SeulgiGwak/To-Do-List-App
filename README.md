📱 Usage
Add Tasks: Type a task in the input field and click the Add Task button to add it to your list.

Mark Tasks as Complete: Check a task (or strike it through) to mark it as completed.

Delete Tasks: Click the Delete button next to any task you want to remove from the list.

🔧 How It Works
Add Tasks: The input box allows you to type in tasks. When you press the Add Task button, a new task is added to the list.

Complete Tasks: Once a task is completed, it can be marked (visually) as completed. This may involve adding a "checked" effect or strikethrough on the task text.

Delete Tasks: If a task is no longer needed, you can click the Delete button next to it to remove it from the list.

🌱 Future Improvements
Add the ability to edit tasks after they’ve been created.

Implement localStorage to save tasks even when the page is refreshed.

Allow users to filter tasks (e.g., show only completed tasks or active tasks).

Add drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks.

🛠️ Roadmap
Task Completion: Implement features to mark tasks as "done" with a checkbox or strikethrough.

Error Handling: Ensure that if the input field is empty, the user is alerted and no task is added.

Styling Enhancements: Improve the overall design, including color schemes, fonts, and animations.
